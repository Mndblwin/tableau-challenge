# tableau-challenge Data Analysis

# General Information
	I selected July 4th as my date of analysis in each year.  I wanted to see what they data may say regarding ridership on a federal holiday as well as a day that would likely have favorable weather conditions for bike riding.  In addition, I would expect a greater number of people to be engaging in some sort of celebratory event and/or engaging in leisurely activities.  
    I also combined each csv into one single csv file.  I originally attempted to utilize a SQLite database, however VScode continued to crash and could not fully upload all of the data to the database.  The tableau graphs are built off of this combined text file, filtered in tableau on the starttime of July 4th.  

# Ridership Analysis
•	Ridership overall, on July 4th each year trended upward over time from 2013-2020.  
•	The number of subscribers has more than doubled during the same time period.  This could be the result of various marketing techniques geared around the holiday.  This could also be the result of individuals attending various 4th of July Celebrations throughout the area and riding to those destinations.
•	Over the same time period for July 4th, the amount of male ridership has also more than doubled.
•	Female ridership has declined over the same time period.  However the gender ridership data may be affected by unknown riders, which actually trended upward over this time period

# Bike Usage Data
•	As noted under the Ridership Analysis section, bike usage has increased over time each July 4th since 2013.  
•	The number 1 station location to depart from is 12 Ave & W 40 Street, even though based on google data, this station only has available 45 bikes.  There are much larger stations throughout the area.  
•	The number of bikes has more than doubled as well for July 4TH over the same time period.
